# üçä Orange Is The New Black: An Obsidian Theme

## Because your notes are sentenced to life, just like your productivity

Welcome to the "Orange Is The New Black" Obsidian theme, where your ideas are locked up tighter than a supermax facility and your creativity is on death row!

### üö® "Features" (aka Cruel and Unusual Punishments):

- **Retro Orange Glow**: Feel like you're writing on a vintage computer... or under the harsh lights of an interrogation room.
- **Dark Mode Only**: Because light is a luxury you don't deserve, inmate.
- **Titlebar Blacker Than Your Soul**: Navigate with the desperation of someone who just dropped the soap.
- **CRT Flicker Effect**: Is it eye strain, or are you finally cracking under the pressure? Who knows!

### ü•Ñ Installation (aka Voluntary Incarceration):

1. Download the theme (No conjugal visits included)
2. Place it in your Obsidian vault's theme folder (Your new 6x8 cell)
3. Activate it and kiss your sanity goodbye

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning (Read or Die):

Side effects may include, but are not limited to:
- Compulsive shiv-making out of paperclips
- Tattooing checkboxes on your knuckles
- Trading your firstborn for an extra Markdown plugin
- Waking up in cold sweats mumbling about "nested lists"

### üé≠ Usage Tips (Survival Guide):

- Headers are the prison hierarchy. Use H1 sparingly, unless you want a bounty on your head.
- Tags are now your gang affiliations. Choose wisely, or end up in protective custody.
- Links are contraband. Every click could be your last.
- Backlinks are snitches. Trust no one.

### üëÆ Support (Pleas for Clemency):

Found a bug? Congratulations, you've got yourself a pet. If it's really bothering you, file a report in the grievance box (aka /dev/null).

Remember, in "Orange Is The New Black" Obsidian theme, your notes are doing hard time... and so are you! 

Now get back to work, maggot! Those notes aren't going to write themselves, and the warden doesn't accept "writer's block" as an excuse for slacking off.

P.S. If you think this theme is too intense, maybe you should go back to your cozy little Notion pages with their soft pastels and rounded corners. This theme is for the hardcore note-takers only. The ones who treat every bullet point like it's a matter of life and death. Because in here, it just might be.
