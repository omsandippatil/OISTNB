# OISTNB - Orange Is the New Black

Welcome to the dark side of Obsidian, where orange isn’t just the new black—it’s the *only* black that matters. This theme is here to set your notes ablaze in shades of fiery brilliance, with just enough black to remind you that life isn’t all sunshine and rainbows—it's more like staring into the void while sipping on a pumpkin spice latte. 

## 🔥 Features

- **Enhanced Color Palette**: You’ve got your oranges, from "Burnt Toast" to "Molten Lava," with blacks darker than your coffee. Your notes will look so good, you might just start taking them seriously.
- **Retro Vibes**: Bask in the glow of yesteryear with fonts that scream "I’ve got a typewriter, and I’m not afraid to use it!" Pair that with a CRT screen effect to really get your nostalgia neurons firing.
- **Black Titlebar**: Because your workspace should be as dark as your humor. It’s sleek, it’s chic, and it doesn’t give a damn about conventional design.
- **Glowing Typography**: Your headers now have the ethereal glow of a late-night diner sign. They might not guide you to the best milkshake, but they will guide your thoughts to a higher plane.
- **Retro Scrollbar**: We even made the scrollbar cool. Who does that? We do. Because details matter.

## 🧑‍💻 Installation

1. **Download** the theme. Obviously. 
2. **Apply** it in your Obsidian settings. Don’t worry, it won’t bite. But it might scorch.
3. **Stare** at your screen in awe. Maybe shed a single tear of joy.

## ⚠️ Warning

Side effects may include:
- Uncontrollable urge to write poetry about the void.
- Sudden appreciation for 70s sci-fi aesthetics.
- The need to explain to your friends why orange *is* the new black.

## 🧡 Final Thoughts

OISTNB is more than just a theme—it’s a lifestyle. So, go ahead, embrace the dark, and let your notes shine in a blaze of orange glory. And remember, in this world, black isn’t just a color; it’s an attitude.
